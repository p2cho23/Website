/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Create two arrays: questions and answers
2. Use document.getElementById to display the question when a button is pressed
3. Allow the user to answer the question in another textbox
4. Use a parameter to check whether their answer was correct
5. Make an if statement that compares their answer to the actual answer using the var counter
6. Use an if statement that adds a point of they were correct
7. Create a button that then cycles to the next question
8. Repeat the process
