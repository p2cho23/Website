<p>In 1960, Harper Lee, an American author and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, published the novel <i> To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, a book revolving around the racial injustice and inequality of a small town in Alabama. Since that time, it has become a literary classic, sparking racial discussions in classrooms all across America and teaching one of the most fundamental aspects of human life: compassion. Upon reading, audiences instantly venerated Atticus Finch, the lawyer tasked with defending an African-American man accused of raping a caucasian woman. Finch himself is a widow and a father of two children, Jean Louise "Scout" and Jem, and has a housekeeper, Calpurnia. All reside in the rural town of Maycomb, Alabama, which supports a strong population of both Caucasians and African-Americans. </p>
<p>     As Atticus once put it, humans can "never really understand a person until [they] consider things from his point of view... until [they] climb into his skin and walk around in it." This concept is regularly exercised throughout <i> To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, however it is mainly demonstrated in Finch's defense of Tom Robinson. In a time of heavy segregation and opposing racial views, Atticus broke through the norm of his time by taking on the State v. Robinson case as a white man. He saw Robinson as a human, not black, nor white, or any shade in between, and carried out his duty as he would with any other defendant. In fact, Finch sat at the jailhouse after Robinson's conviction in fear of people coming to terrorize the man, demonstrating his absolute dedication and sympathy to his client. His actions have made him a luminary for proper justice and an icon among lawyers to this day. In his personal life, Finch takes time to explain important life lessons to his children instead of brushing off their questions due to their young age. He teaches them the importance of morality, respect, and courage, the latter through his stance in the Robinson case. As a defender, a lawyer, and an altruist, it is fair to say that Atticus Finch constitutes what it means to be a hero. </p>
